# My 41189 Reflective Portfolio 
## Week 6

### What have I learnt this week?
Upon reflection, this week I learnt about how complex systems change and evolve over time. 
Furthermore, we learnt about Markov models and went into detail about how they capture systems that transition probabilistically between a finite number of states. From this I also gained knowledge on the fact that a system can move from one state to another through a set of transitions. We then covered random walk models which refers to a literal random walk. The model itself consists of random paths taken for each step creating 2 steps of equal likelihood however the only difference between markov chain and random walks being that markov chains maintain memoryless property. 

Additionally, to further enhance our newly gained knowledge, as a class we modeled a discrete markov chain and drew a markov chain to obtain the corresponding stochastic matrix.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
The concept of Random Walks was relatively self-explanatory and I had a general idea of what it was even before the lesson. However, the idea of a stochastic process was very new to me and I found the concept of an evolving system very interesting.
Did not know that if a student was rich he can actually end up poor or in debt if they got really unlucky with their random walks. Quite amusing actually. 

### What insights have I gained?
Key takeaways/insights that I have gained from this lesson was that Markov models are very flexible and can be applied to many if not all situations. They are also simple to implement, memoryless and can help describe the evolution of a system over time in detail. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
This week I did not encounter problems with concentration and in fact I believe that a strength of mine that I observed this week was understanding the concept of both Markov and Random Walk Models really well with minimal help.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Fortunately, this week I actually did not face any challenges at all. If anything the only problem that came across was the fact that I started to become lazy with my weekly journal updates which has nothing to do with the lesson.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Rather than do better I would like to keep this work ethic up when attending classes. This due to the fact that a majority of the lessons I somewhat struggle to stay concentrated on the given material. 

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
I think in this case the general idea of complex systems changing and evolving was the most useful theory. This is due to the fact that all of the models studied and mentioned today used this theory as its foundation.
