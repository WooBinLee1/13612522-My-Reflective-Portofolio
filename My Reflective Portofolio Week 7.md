# My 41189 Reflective Portfolio 
## Week 7

### What have I learnt this week?
This week I learnt about six different new models that explained how things spread, coordinate, how culture arises and how we learn as individuals. I was given insight into how we as people influence and learn from one another and how peer effects, social contagion, coordination, culture exist literally everywhere. As a class we discussed the case of Covid 19 as a lesson of social contagion where social contagion is driven by high variance rather than mean behaviour.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I learnt about different social contagion models and why/ how things spread.
I also did not know that COVID 19 could be a potential lesson in social contagion because I only ever saw it as a menace ruining our livelihood.

### What insights have I gained?
One of the multiple insights I gained from this lesson is the fact Micro incentives do not necessarily equal marco outcomes. This outcome is represented in Schelling’s segregation model where alternative hypotheses can be tested to model people’s behaviours and aggregate these behaviours to look at the possible outcomes of a given scenario. 
Another would be the interesting model of Granovetter’s model where an outcome varies as the thresholds are varied. Furthermore, I have come to the conclusion that these models are extremely flexible when it comes to applications and can be applied to given scenarios to stimulate or hinder contagion. In terms of culture I learnt that culture has to be modelled consistently or else error can occur ultimately leading to large amounts of heterogeneity.
Finally, Replicator Dynamics was the last insight that I gained as I had literally no Idea what it was until I was given an explanation that it was an interesting type of social learning models that are used in different disciplines. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
This week, my biggest weakness was really trying to stay awake in class as I had previously had an assignment due the next day. 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Challenges that I faced this week was literally trying to stay awake in class to have fruitful discussion and learn the content that I was being given.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
In hopes of fixing my perceived weaknesses from the question above, I will try to better my time management so that I will be able to concentrate in class to take in all the content that I am learning. However, I do know I am not the only student prone to this behaviour as I know my group mates have also experienced what I am currently experiencing.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
This week the theory that proved to be most useful was Fisher’s theorem where the rate of adaptation was explained. The theorem noted that the rate of adaptation is proportional to the variation in the given population meaning that a lot of variation is required in order to adapt faster. I did not necessarily find this significantly useful but more so interesting when asked how we could increase the variation in the context of wearing masks.
