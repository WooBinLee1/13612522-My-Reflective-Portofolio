# My 41189 Reflective Portfolio 
## Week 5

### What have I learnt this week?
Upon reflection, this week I learnt about the essence of ABM (agent based Modelling) and how heterogeneous and autonomous agents engage in interactions. Furthermore, we as a class participated in class exercises where we drew a conceptual diagram of a given scenario and were able to learn how to model the relevant interactions between the agents. We not only learnt how to draw the conceptual diagram but also identify the agents, attributes, interactions and decisions. 

Additionally, in groups we explored the concept of aggregating decisions and behaviour where we studied real world phenomena that we believed to follow different types of distributions (probability distribution models).

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
- I now know that not every distribution is normal as not every quantity will not be written as the sum of independent random variables.
- I never knew how to construct an algorithm and this lesson served as an experience for me to do just that.
- I also now know that studying distributions help us in modelling complex systems and preparing for risk handling.

### What insights have I gained?
One insight that I have gained reflecting on this lesson was that ABMs are paramount towards understanding many forms of applications. ABMs are able to simulate the agents, attributes, interactions and decisions of a given scenario which ultimately helps us understand and study them.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Unfortunately, my shortcoming this week was the fact that I was unable to focus this week and my concentration levels were very low as I was not engaged in the material. In terms of strengths I do not think I had any. 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) 
With Challenges, the group work was somewhat difficult as most of us initially did not understand the concept of a conceptual diagram and a UML class diagram. However, we did manage to pull through the work in the end thanks to our tutor.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next time I would like to stay focused in class so that I would not have to revise my work later and fall behind on content. 

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
This week I believe the concept that proved the most useful was the theory of types of random variables. I believe this to be the case due to the fact that random variables are essential towards modelling ABMs and identifying different types of distributions.
