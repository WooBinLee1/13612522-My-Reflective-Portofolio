# My 41189 Reflective Portfolio
## Week 2

What have I learnt this week?
This Week I learnt about the key attributes of a system
- Elements
- Relationships 
- Function

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

I did not know that ‘simple’ systems involved such complex systems where many subsystems are interdependent in order to work

### What insights have I gained?

One insight that I’ve gained from this week was that there are multiple levels of complexity and can be defined as the following:

- Static
- Dynamic 
- Generic

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

One of my biggest weaknesses would likely be my inability to instantly grasp a good idea of the content that I am learning. I often take my time and take a while for me to understand a concept once I have reviewed it.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) 

I initially had a hard time talking as I was not very confident in my understanding of the content that I was learning at the time.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

If anything I would probably try to put in more effort to engage with my given group

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

I learnt that complex systems cannot simply be understood just by looking at its parts and these computer information systems tend to work the same way as human systems. This is useful because it helps understand any system better whether it be human systems or computer systems.
