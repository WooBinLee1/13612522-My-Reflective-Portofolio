# My 41189 Reflective Portfolio 
## Week 2

### What have I learnt this week?
We attempted to understand how models can help us build and improve our understanding of complex adaptive systems. 

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
- Complex systems are messy
- Modelling provides the tools to experiment and test ideas
- “ Wisdom of crowd”
- All models are wrong however MANY tend to be quite useful

### What insights have I gained?
By understanding a variety of flexible models they help address the complex adaptive systems problems.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
At this point in time I did not really see a weakness in myself

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) 
I honestly think I did a pretty good job at understanding this weeks content and there were not many times where I had to stop and think what the hell am I reading like I did last week.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Practice critical thinking and make sure I actually have take aways by the end of class instead of not paying attention.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory of rational vs behavioural vs rule based models taught me that people’s behaviours can actually be modelled in a way that we can understand what a person might be thinking and with these models we are able to predict cognitive biases and what systems they use to think.
