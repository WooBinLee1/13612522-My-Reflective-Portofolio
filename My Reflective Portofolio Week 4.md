# My 41189 Reflective Portfolio 
## Week 4

### What have I learnt this week?
We looked at the basics of various models and learnt about the implementation details of the models.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
Learned about the five phase process where it would start with problem structuring, then causal loop modelling, dynamic modelling, scenario planning and modelling then transition into implementation and organisational learning.

### What insights have I gained?
An insight that I gained is that there are multiple common modes of behaviour and they all inhibit different fundamental behaviours like exponential growth, oscillation, etc.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I donâ€™t know.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) 
I did find drawing out the stock flow system somewhat difficult as I did struggle to grasp the idea of system dynamics models. However, I eventually got the hang of it.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
In this case where I struggled to understand the concept of a model, I would probably try to break it down further in order to help me understand the concept better.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Not necessarily a theory however the image of networks helped me understand the concept of network formation better as it the image showed how the nodes are attached to each other to support each entity.
