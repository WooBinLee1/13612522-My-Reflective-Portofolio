# My 41189 Reflective Portfolio 
## Week 4

### What have I learnt this week?
This week we learnt specifically about models and the basics of each method. Furthermore, we looked at the basics of each method and discussed the implementation details of each model in our given groups. We also participated in a in class group activity where we developed a CLD (Casual loop diagram) depicting a given scenario. WIth this CLD we then created a stock flow model to determine the progress of our given event.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I learnt many things this week including many different types of models as well as how to distinguish these models from others. I also learnt that there are three different ways to model complex adaptive systems;
- System dynamics models
- Networks models
- Agent based models

Additionally, we also learnt how to develop a basic casual loop diagram as well as create a stock flow model for a given scenario which in this case was covid 19.
I also Learnt about the five phase process where it would start with problem structuring, then causal loop modelling, dynamic modelling, scenario planning and modelling then transition into implementation and organisational learning.

### What insights have I gained?
An insight that I gained is that there are multiple common modes of behaviour and they all inhibit different fundamental behaviours like exponential growth, oscillation, etc.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I donâ€™t know.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) 
I did find drawing out the stock flow system somewhat difficult as I did struggle to grasp the idea of system dynamics models. However, I eventually got the hang of it.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
In this case where I struggled to understand the concept of a model, I would probably try to break it down further in order to help me understand the concept better.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Not necessarily a theory however the image of networks helped me understand the concept of network formation better as it the image showed how the nodes are attached to each other to support each entity.
