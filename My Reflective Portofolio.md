## Week 2

What have I learnt this week?
This Week I learnt about the key attributes of a system
- Elements
- Relationships 
- Function

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?

I did not know that ‘simple’ systems involved such complex systems where many subsystems are interdependent in order to work

### What insights have I gained?

One insight that I’ve gained from this week was that there are multiple levels of complexity and can be defined as the following:

- Static
- Dynamic 
- Generic

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?

One of my biggest weaknesses would likely be my inability to instantly grasp a good idea of the content that I am learning. I often take my time and take a while for me to understand a concept once I have reviewed it.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) 

I initially had a hard time talking as I was not very confident in my understanding of the content that I was learning at the time.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?

If anything I would probably try to put in more effort to engage with my given group

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?

I learnt that complex systems cannot simply be understood just by looking at its parts and these computer information systems tend to work the same way as human systems. This is useful because it helps understand any system better whether it be human systems or computer systems.

## Week 3

### What have I learnt this week?
We attempted to understand how models can help us build and improve our understanding of complex adaptive systems. 

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
- Complex systems are messy
- Modelling provides the tools to experiment and test ideas
- “ Wisdom of crowd”
- All models are wrong however MANY tend to be quite useful

### What insights have I gained?
By understanding a variety of flexible models they help address the complex adaptive systems problems.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
At this point in time I did not really see a weakness in myself

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) 
I honestly think I did a pretty good job at understanding this weeks content and there were not many times where I had to stop and think what the hell am I reading like I did last week.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Practice critical thinking and make sure I actually have take aways by the end of class instead of not paying attention.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory of rational vs behavioural vs rule based models taught me that people’s behaviours can actually be modelled in a way that we can understand what a person might be thinking and with these models we are able to predict cognitive biases and what systems they use to think.

## Week 4

### What have I learnt this week?
This week we learnt specifically about models and the basics of each method. Furthermore, we looked at the basics of each method and discussed the implementation details of each model in our given groups. We also participated in a in class group activity where we developed a CLD (Casual loop diagram) depicting a given scenario. WIth this CLD we then created a stock flow model to determine the progress of our given event.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I learnt many things this week including many different types of models as well as how to distinguish these models from others. I also learnt that there are three different ways to model complex adaptive systems;
- System dynamics models
- Networks models
- Agent based models

Additionally, we also learnt how to develop a basic casual loop diagram as well as create a stock flow model for a given scenario which in this case was covid 19.
I also Learnt about the five phase process where it would start with problem structuring, then causal loop modelling, dynamic modelling, scenario planning and modelling then transition into implementation and organisational learning.

### What insights have I gained?
An insight that I gained is that there are multiple common modes of behaviour and they all inhibit different fundamental behaviours like exponential growth, oscillation, etc.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I don’t know.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) 
I did find drawing out the stock flow system somewhat difficult as I did struggle to grasp the idea of system dynamics models. However, I eventually got the hang of it.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
In this case where I struggled to understand the concept of a model, I would probably try to break it down further in order to help me understand the concept better.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Not necessarily a theory however the image of networks helped me understand the concept of network formation better as it the image showed how the nodes are attached to each other to support each entity.

## Week 5

### What have I learnt this week?
Upon reflection, this week I learnt about the essence of ABM (agent based Modelling) and how heterogeneous and autonomous agents engage in interactions. Furthermore, we as a class participated in class exercises where we drew a conceptual diagram of a given scenario and were able to learn how to model the relevant interactions between the agents. We not only learnt how to draw the conceptual diagram but also identify the agents, attributes, interactions and decisions. 

Additionally, in groups we explored the concept of aggregating decisions and behaviour where we studied real world phenomena that we believed to follow different types of distributions (probability distribution models).

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
- I now know that not every distribution is normal as not every quantity will not be written as the sum of independent random variables.
- I never knew how to construct an algorithm and this lesson served as an experience for me to do just that.
- I also now know that studying distributions help us in modelling complex systems and preparing for risk handling.

### What insights have I gained?
One insight that I have gained reflecting on this lesson was that ABMs are paramount towards understanding many forms of applications. ABMs are able to simulate the agents, attributes, interactions and decisions of a given scenario which ultimately helps us understand and study them.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
Unfortunately, my shortcoming this week was the fact that I was unable to focus this week and my concentration levels were very low as I was not engaged in the material. In terms of strengths I do not think I had any. 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) 
With Challenges, the group work was somewhat difficult as most of us initially did not understand the concept of a conceptual diagram and a UML class diagram. However, we did manage to pull through the work in the end thanks to our tutor.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next time I would like to stay focused in class so that I would not have to revise my work later and fall behind on content. 

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
This week I believe the concept that proved the most useful was the theory of types of random variables. I believe this to be the case due to the fact that random variables are essential towards modelling ABMs and identifying different types of distributions.

## Week 6

### What have I learnt this week?
Upon reflection, this week I learnt about how complex systems change and evolve over time. 
Furthermore, we learnt about Markov models and went into detail about how they capture systems that transition probabilistically between a finite number of states. From this I also gained knowledge on the fact that a system can move from one state to another through a set of transitions. We then covered random walk models which refers to a literal random walk. The model itself consists of random paths taken for each step creating 2 steps of equal likelihood however the only difference between markov chain and random walks being that markov chains maintain memoryless property. 

Additionally, to further enhance our newly gained knowledge, as a class we modeled a discrete markov chain and drew a markov chain to obtain the corresponding stochastic matrix.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
The concept of Random Walks was relatively self-explanatory and I had a general idea of what it was even before the lesson. However, the idea of a stochastic process was very new to me and I found the concept of an evolving system very interesting.
Did not know that if a student was rich he can actually end up poor or in debt if they got really unlucky with their random walks. Quite amusing actually. 

### What insights have I gained?
Key takeaways/insights that I have gained from this lesson was that Markov models are very flexible and can be applied to many if not all situations. They are also simple to implement, memoryless and can help describe the evolution of a system over time in detail. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
This week I did not encounter problems with concentration and in fact I believe that a strength of mine that I observed this week was understanding the concept of both Markov and Random Walk Models really well with minimal help.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Fortunately, this week I actually did not face any challenges at all. If anything the only problem that came across was the fact that I started to become lazy with my weekly journal updates which has nothing to do with the lesson.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Rather than do better I would like to keep this work ethic up when attending classes. This due to the fact that a majority of the lessons I somewhat struggle to stay concentrated on the given material. 

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
I think in this case the general idea of complex systems changing and evolving was the most useful theory. This is due to the fact that all of the models studied and mentioned today used this theory as its foundation.

## Week 7

### What have I learnt this week?
This week I learnt about six different new models that explained how things spread, coordinate, how culture arises and how we learn as individuals. I was given insight into how we as people influence and learn from one another and how peer effects, social contagion, coordination, culture exist literally everywhere. As a class we discussed the case of Covid 19 as a lesson of social contagion where social contagion is driven by high variance rather than mean behaviour.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
I learnt about different social contagion models and why/ how things spread.
I also did not know that COVID 19 could be a potential lesson in social contagion because I only ever saw it as a menace ruining our livelihood.

### What insights have I gained?
One of the multiple insights I gained from this lesson is the fact Micro incentives do not necessarily equal marco outcomes. This outcome is represented in Schelling’s segregation model where alternative hypotheses can be tested to model people’s behaviours and aggregate these behaviours to look at the possible outcomes of a given scenario. 
Another would be the interesting model of Granovetter’s model where an outcome varies as the thresholds are varied. Furthermore, I have come to the conclusion that these models are extremely flexible when it comes to applications and can be applied to given scenarios to stimulate or hinder contagion. In terms of culture I learnt that culture has to be modelled consistently or else error can occur ultimately leading to large amounts of heterogeneity.
Finally, Replicator Dynamics was the last insight that I gained as I had literally no Idea what it was until I was given an explanation that it was an interesting type of social learning models that are used in different disciplines. 

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
This week, my biggest weakness was really trying to stay awake in class as I had previously had an assignment due the next day. 

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
Challenges that I faced this week was literally trying to stay awake in class to have fruitful discussion and learn the content that I was being given.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
In hopes of fixing my perceived weaknesses from the question above, I will try to better my time management so that I will be able to concentrate in class to take in all the content that I am learning. However, I do know I am not the only student prone to this behaviour as I know my group mates have also experienced what I am currently experiencing.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
This week the theory that proved to be most useful was Fisher’s theorem where the rate of adaptation was explained. The theorem noted that the rate of adaptation is proportional to the variation in the given population meaning that a lot of variation is required in order to adapt faster. I did not necessarily find this significantly useful but more so interesting when asked how we could increase the variation in the context of wearing masks.

## Week 8

### What have I learnt this week?
This week we learnt about two different intriguing models from game theory. The first was the colonel blotto game where the game is a zero sum game that predicts winners and losers based on the allocation of limited resources across various fronts. It’s a simple game that has the potential of having very complicated outcomes due to its structure where no strategy is dominant and all have an equal chance of being defeated.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
That Zero sum means there is a winner and loser.
Blotto helps understand how everyone has the same chance at winning and explains empirical patterns. Furthermore, it helps estimate how much of a resource should be used and where it should be allocated.

### What insights have I gained?
One insight that I have gained from this lesson was the indisputable fact that the colonel blotto game is quite relevant in terms of real world applications. Whether it be sports where tennis players compete, or trials where lawyers clash over different lines of defence there is no best strategy towards an outcome and anyone can win. Though the fact that a weaker player may have fewer resources remains true, it does not change the fact that anyone has a chance at winning if players allocate their resources correctly to best help them in their favour.

Another is the concept of cooperation:The Prisoner’s Dilemma where we watched cookie men as an example where multiple scenarios are shown to depict the outcomes of their decisions. The insight I gained from watching this was the interesting fact that the best option would be for both players to coordinate to get the highest collaboration payoff; however, If this approach is not taken one will always benefit over the other due to the structure of the model.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
When it comes to my strengths, I’ve noticed I am able to grasp concepts and theories much more easily when it is visually depicted e.g a video. The Prisoner’s Dilemma was very easy to understand due to the video shown in our tutorial. In terms of weaknesses it would be the complete opposite where I struggle to understand concepts without visual stimuli.

### What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
In terms of challenges, not necessarily to do with the tutorial, I struggled more with my group’s week 8 Github pre submission as my group members were pretty unorganised and did not reply to the allocated group chat to discuss assessments. Furthermore, we had trouble actually listing conceptual models to use in our assignment due to the fact that some members did not attend classes at all and had not read up on the models necessary to understand the given content.

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
In regards to the question above If possible (if there is) I would like to form my groups more carefully as in this case it was very difficult to stay organised and not be pressed on time when it came to assessments. Another thing would also be my own time management as I left almost half of the weekly repositories until the last minute. 

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
With the theory that proved the most intriguing rather than useful was the concept of the infinite prisoner's dilemma where it captures the essence of tension forced between two parties when faced with a predicament. With this the parties end up having to decide between doing what is good for the individual or what is good for everyone and I personally find this very interesting.
In terms of what I learnt, I learnt that with the given statistics of the given theory there exists an incentive for either two parties to defect to create the best outcomes for themselves which ultimately creates the tension.
